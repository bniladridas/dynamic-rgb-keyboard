# Engineering Behind the Keyboard Project

## Hardware Design
The keyboard hardware is designed using a custom PCB with mechanical switches. The PCB layout is created using KiCad.

## Firmware
The firmware is based on the QMK firmware, which is an open-source firmware for mechanical keyboards. It allows for extensive customization and supports various features like macros and RGB lighting.

## Software
The configuration software is developed using Electron, allowing it to run on multiple platforms. It provides a user-friendly interface for customizing key mappings and settings.

## Testing
Both hardware and software components are rigorously tested to ensure reliability and performance. Automated tests are used to verify the functionality of the firmware and software.
